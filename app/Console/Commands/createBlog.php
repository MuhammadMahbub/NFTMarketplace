                                    And that team has been busy. In 2021, weve shipped more features than ever before, scaled to a multi-chain platform with Flow and Tezos integrations, and watched our community soar on every social media channel.
                                    And of course, we could not have done it without you! You are creating Rarible day by day - by using the platform, requesting features, sharing your feedback, being as active and passionate as you are.',
